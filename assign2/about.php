                                <dd>I come from a close-knit family of four and currently reside in Carlton, a place I've grown fond of since moving to Australia in Year 10. Interestingly, my early education also began here, as I attended kindergarten in this beautiful country. I've always been deeply passionate about engineering and computing science. My dream is to merge these fields, aspiring to become a civil engineer who seamlessly integrates AI and programming into projects. What fuels my passion is the sheer joy I find in problem-solving, the process of unraveling complexities and finding solutions. Carlton offers the perfect balance of life for me - it's just a 15-minute walk to the bustling city and a mere minute away from the serene Carlton Gardens and the informative Melbourne Museum. Every morning, as I wait for my bus to uni, I take a moment to bask in the picturesque views that surround me. The vibes, the breathtaking views, the invigorating fresh air, and the rich culture of Australia resonate deeply with me, making every day here truly special.</dd>

                                <dd>I hail from the vibrant city of Hong Kong. There's so much I cherish about my hometown, from the 'yum cha' dining experience to the unique taste of our local silk milk tea. Living near Victoria Peak, I often found myself hiking its trails. In just half an hour, I'd be at the top, taking in the stunning views of the city. It was my personal escape in the heart of the urban jungle. One thing I truly appreciate about Hong Kong is its public transportation. The MTRs, buses, and trams made exploring the city easy and car-free. It's a convenience I often find myself missing.To sum it up, Hong Kong is a blend of fast-paced city life, rich culture, and natural beauty, and it will always hold a special place in my heart.</dd>

                                <dd>I  was born and raised in the vibrant southern city of Vietnam called Bien Hoa city  and has been fortunate to experience a diverse and international upbringing. Growing up in a dynamic environment,From a young age, Im exhibited a passion for sports and cooking. Interestingly, I wasn't always immersed in the world of computers and technology. During their formative years, technology wasn't a central interest. However, everything changed when I entered high school. High school introduced them to the exciting realm of computer science, and they discovered a new avenue for learning and creativity. As they dived into various computer science projects, then I found a hidden passion for coding, problem-solving, and the endless possibilities that technology offered. This newfound interest led myself  to make a pivotal decision – they chose to pursue computer science as their academic focus. Looking ahead, I envision a future as a data scientist within the fintech industry. With a strong interest in finance and technology, I aspire to leverage my analytical skills to drive innovation in the financial sector.</dd>

With a rich cultural heritage, a thriving economy, and picturesque landscapes, Bien Hoa City has earned its place as a dynamic and vibrant urban center. The cultural tapestry of Bien Hoa is woven from the threads of its diverse population. Residents from various backgrounds coexist harmoniously, creating a vibrant fusion of traditions, customs, and cuisines. Pagodas, temples, and churches stand as symbols of the city's religious tolerance and cultural heritage. Festivals such as Lunar New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival bring the community together in a display of unity. As a proud resident of Bien Hoa City, I find myself privileged to be part of this vibrant community that seamlessly weaves together history, culture, and progress. Living in this city has not only allowed me to experience its rich heritage but has also given me a front-row seat to witness its remarkable transformation into a modern urban center.</dd>

                                <dd>I was born and raised in southern Vietnam, specifically Ho Chi Minh City, and I spent most of my time there before moving to Australia. My family has a grocery store back in my hometown, and that is also my parents' full-time job. The store has gone through highs and lows, but luckily, we still managed to get through the COVID-19 pandemic and make enough money for me to study abroad. I used to study at a normal secondary school, but I managed to get into one of the most prestigious high schools in Vietnam, and then I got a scholarship to study in Swinburne. I really enjoy staying in Vietnam since the living cost here is really cheap, and Ho Chi Minh city is a mix of various cultures around the world, including Vietnamese and Chinese.</dd>

                                <dd>As I said, I was raised in Ho Chi Minh City, and it is one of the most interesting and populous cities in Vietnam, with a mix of inhabitants and foreigners visiting all the time. Ho Chi Minh City has a variety of cuisine, mostly Vietnamese and Chinese cuisines, and they are mostly very cheap, starting from $3. Using motorbikes is also one of the common things here since most roads in Ho Chi Minh are small and can only be accessed using motorbikes. Besides, public transportation is not very popular here since there are only buses, and it will take a long time for you to get to the destination. All in all, Ho Chi Minh City, to me, is a very important city, and I will return there one day.</dd>
